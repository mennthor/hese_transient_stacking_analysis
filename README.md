Analysis wiki: [Transient_HESE_Stacking](https://wiki.icecube.wisc.edu/index.php/Transient_HESE_Stacking)

To redo the analysis:

1) Clone this repo
2) Install python software dependencies with `pip install --user -e .` in their repos:
    - myi3scripts:
    - tdepps (Note: Needs devset2 to compile the C++ backend)
3) Execute each script in order (some need to be run as cluster jobs).
